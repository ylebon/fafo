The GitHub Arctic Code Vault is a data repository preserved in the Arctic World Archive (AWA), a very-long-term archival facility 250 meters deep in the permafrost of an Arctic mountain.

GitHub captured a snapshot of every active public repository on 02/02/2020 and preserved that data in the Arctic Code Vault. :)
