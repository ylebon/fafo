# FAFO

The GitHub Arctic Code Vault is a data repository preserved in the Arctic World Archive (AWA), a very-long-term archival facility 250 meters deep in the permafrost of an Arctic mountain.

GitHub captured a snapshot of every active public repository on 02/02/2020 and preserved that data in the Arctic Code Vault. :)

# Prerequisites

- "A journal is a written record of incidents, experiences, and ideas. Also known as a personal journal notebook, diary, and log. Writers often keep journals to record observations and explore ideas that may eventually be developed into more formal essays, articles, and stories. "The personal journal is a very private document" says Brian ..." - https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-a-journal-1691206

- "Privacy is a fundamental human right. It’s also one of our core values. Which is why we design our products and services to protect it. That’s the kind of innovation we believe in." - https://www.apple.com/privacy/

- "L'UE est fondée sur un engagement résolu à promouvoir et protéger les droits de l'homme, la démocratie et l’État de droit partout dans le monde. Les droits de l'homme sont au cœur des relations de l'UE avec les autres pays et régions." - https://european-union.europa.eu/priorities-and-actions/actions-topic/human-rights-and-democracy_fr

- "The EU has imposed sanctions on six senior Russian officials and a chemical research centre over the Novichok poisoning of anti-Putin campaigner Alexei Navalny. " - https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54552480

Out of curiosity: Who is supposed to sanction EU if there is a poisoning attempt from EU?

- "EU corruption scandal puts democracy under attack - European Parliament head" - https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-63941509

- "Police in Brussels have raided a lockdown orgy in the basement of a gay bar – collaring 25 people, including several diplomats and a member of the European Parliament, according to reports." - https://nypost.com/2020/12/01/brussels-cops-bust-lockdown-orgy-attended-by-diplomats-reports/

- "As nouns the difference between persecutor and prosecutor is that persecutor is a person or thing that persecutes or harasses while prosecutor is a lawyer who decides whether to charge a person with a crime and tries to prove in court that the person is guilty." - https://wikidiff.com/prosecutor/persecutor

In some cases prosecutor can be also a persecutor, when prosecutor exploits laws and his/her network in both worlds (ying and yang) to harass someone so he/her stays on governement payroll or for job promotion. For example: exploiting EU law about disease (COVID), exploiting EU laws about nationalities, exploiting laws in the countries you visit if you are travelling, etc

- "The couple met when Emmanuel was only 15 years old ... It is often said that Emmanuel developed very warm feelings for his teacher, and the two started a relationship, which adds that the sexual minimum age in France is 15 years. Thus, nothing illegal should have taken place." - https://timespek.com/love-story-emmanuel-and-brigitte-macron/

- "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has announced that new evidence has emerged linking Pfizer Covid shots to blood clotting, according to reports." - https://ussanews.com/2022/12/17/fda-pfizers-covid-shots-linked-to-blood-clotting/

If there is a blood clotting in the brain, an assault with a blow on the head is the first explanation.
